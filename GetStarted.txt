For connecting to abel:
	ssh -Y abel.uio.no
Loading the modules:
	For working with thread building block we have to load intel/2016.0 module .
compile the file :
	icpc parallel_for.cpp -I/cluster/software/VERSIONS/intel-2016.0/compilers_and_libraries_2016.0.109/linux/tbb/include 
	-L/cluster/software/VERSIONS/intel-2016.0/compilers_and_libraries_2016.0.109/linux/tbb/lib/intel64_lin/gcc4.4
	-o parallel -openmp -std=c++11 -ltbb
Also we have to add dynamic dependency libraries which in our case I have
(This will cause some security issues)
added :
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/cluster/software/VERSIONS/intel-2016.0/compilers_and_libraries_2016.0.109/linux/tbb/lib/intel64_lin/gcc4.4
(Recommended)
	go to this directory:
		/cluster/software/VERSIONS/intel-2016.0/compilers_and_libraries_2016.0.109/linux/tbb/bin
		
		OR

		$TBBROOT/bin

	then we have to use this command :
		 source tbbvars.sh intel64
